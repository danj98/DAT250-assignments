# DAT250 Assingment 2 - Report

## Technical issues
Installation itself was no issue due to the pre-made Maven project. I had some issues with the default paths for experiment 1 due to permissions on linux which I had to change. Using IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate made importing all JARs and Maven dependencies easy. The premade project for experiment 2 was a bit of a mess and made the project a lot more confusing than it needed to be. Usage of JPA was easy enough once I read the documentation.

## Inspection of database
On IntelliJ IDEA, inspecting the database was easy due to the visualization tools included. Here is a screenshot of the final database tables:
